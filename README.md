Coding challenge for Software Engineering Placement 2022

This project contains code snippets to return tracks from a theoretical music library database.

The `sqlstatment.sql` contains a query where it returns: 
* data from more than one table that are linked by a relationship
* the track artist, title, genre, and duration
* tracks from the last year
* in the order of artist and title ascending

The `listofmusictracks.html` contains a list of music tracks.

The `Program.cs` contains a program where informations are inserted in a list and uses the class model from `MusicLibrary.cs` and it: 
* returns more than one tracks.
* returns tracks with matching genre.
* returns no tracks with zero duration.
